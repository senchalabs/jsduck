    <h1>Registration Form</h1>

    <p>This example shows a common site registration form. The form appears simple but it shows a few special things: </p>
    <ul class="feature-list">
        <li>The display of field errors has been customized. Fields have <code>msgTarget:'none'</code> so
            the errors are not displayed with the individual fields; instead event listeners are attached
            to the FormPanel to group up all error messages into a custom global error indicator, with a
            persistent tooltip showing the error details.</li>
        <li>The "Terms of Use" link has an event handler attached so it opens the page in a modal Ext window.</li>
        <li>The password fields have custom validation attached to verify the user enters the same value in both.</li>
        <li>The submit button has <code>formBind:true</code> so it is only enabled when the form becomes valid.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The js is not minified so it is readable. See <a href="registration.js">registration.js</a>.</p>
