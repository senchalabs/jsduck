 * @class Ext.data.Batch
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Provides a mechanism to run one or more {@link Ext.data.Operation operations} in a given order. Fires the 'operationcomplete' event
 * after the completion of each Operation, and the 'complete' event when all Operations have been successfully executed. Fires an 'exception'
 * event if any of the Operations encounter an exception.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Usually these are only used internally by {@link Ext.data.proxy.Proxy} classes&lt;/p&gt;

</span>     * @cfg {Boolean} pauseOnException
     * True to pause the execution of the batch if any operation encounters an exception
     * (defaults to false). If you set this to true you are responsible for implementing the appropriate
     * handling logic and restarting or discarding the batch as needed. There are different ways you could 
     * do this, e.g. by handling the batch's {@link #exception} event directly, or perhaps by overriding
     * {@link Ext.data.AbstractStore#onBatchException onBatchException} at the store level. If you do pause
     * and attempt to handle the exception you can call {@link #retry} to process the same operation again. 
     * 
     * Note that {@link Ext.data.Operation operations} are atomic, so any operations that may have succeeded
     * prior to an exception (and up until pausing the batch) will be finalized at the server level and will
     * not be automatically reversible. Any transactional / rollback behavior that might be desired would have
     * to be implemented at the application level. Pausing on exception will likely be most beneficial when
     * used in coordination with such a scheme, where an exception might actually affect subsequent operations
     * in the same batch and so should be handled before continuing with the next operation.
     * 
     * If you have not implemented transactional operation handling then this option should typically be left 
     * to the default of false (e.g. process as many operations as possible, and handle any exceptions 
     * asynchronously without holding up the rest of the batch).
