This is the Appcelerator fork of JSDuck, which contains several modifications to

repo contains related scripts and configuration files for building the docs.

API documentation generator for Sencha JavaScript frameworks.

JSDuck aims to be a better documentation generator for [Ext JS][] than
the old [ext-doc][] was. It is used by Sencha to document [Ext JS
4][ext4-docs], [Sencha Touch][touch2-docs] and [several other][other-docs]
products.

The highlights of JSDuck are [Markdown][] support and keeping you DRY
by inferring a lot of information from code.  Read the
[documentation][] for full overview.

Getting it
----------

Standard rubygems install should do:

    $ [sudo] gem install jsduck

Or download the [Windows binary][winbin]. When you run into problems,
see the [installation guide][].

[installation guide]: https://github.com/senchalabs/jsduck/wiki/Installation

Usage
-----

For the simplest test-run just use the `--builtin-classes` option to
write documentation for JavaScript builtin classes like Array, String
and Object into `docs` directory:

    $ jsduck --builtin-classes --output docs

To generate docs for [Ext JS 4][] add path to the corresponding src/ dir:

    $ jsduck ext-4.2.1/src --output docs

And to create docs for your own Ext JS project, list the directory
with your files in addition to the Ext JS source files (this way the
docs of your classes will list all the properties and methods they
inherit from Ext JS classes):

    $ jsduck ext-4.2.1/src my-project/js --output docs

Unfortunately the above will throw lots of warnings at you, as
building the full Ext JS docs requires lots of additional settings.
For start you might want to simply ignore all these warnings
originating from Ext JS source:

    $ jsduck ext-4.2.1/src my-project/js --output docs \
             --warnings=-all:ext-4.2.1/src

But see the [Usage guide][] for more information on building Ext JS 4
docs.
