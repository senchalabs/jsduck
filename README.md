JSDuck
======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/senchalabs/jsduck.png)](https://travis-ci.org/senchalabs/jsduck)

API documentation generator for Sencha JavaScript frameworks.

JSDuck aims to be a better documentation generator for [Ext JS][] than
the old [ext-doc][] was. It is used by Sencha to document [Ext JS
4][ext4-docs], [Sencha Touch][touch2-docs] and [several other][other-docs]
products.

The highlights of JSDuck are [Markdown][] support and keeping you DRY
by inferring a lot of information from code.  Read the
[documentation][] for full overview.

Getting it
----------

Standard rubygems install should do:

    $ [sudo] gem install jsduck

Windows users probably want to [download a binary release][winbin].

See the [installation guide][] for help when you run into problems.

[winbin]: https://sourceforge.net/projects/jsduck/files/

Usage
-----

For the simplest test-run just use the `--builtin-classes` option to
automatically produce documentation for JavaScript builtin classes
like Array, String and Object:

    $ jsduck --builtin-classes --output your/docs

You can also use `--verbose` option to see what's actually happening.

To generate docs for Ext JS 4 add path to the corresponding src/ dir:

    $ jsduck ext-4.1.1/src \
             --builtin-classes \
             --images ext-4.1.1/docs/images \
             --warnings=-no_doc,-dup_member,-link_ambiguous \
             --external XMLHttpRequest \
             --output your/docs

The `--images` option specifies a path for images included with
`{@img}` tags inside the source code.

The `--warnings` option disables some of the warnings which you would
otherwise be overwhelmed with. That's because Ext JS 4.1.1 was
released when JSDuck 4 wasn't out yet.  Sorry for that, JSDuck just
wants to be helpful. Similarly the `--external` option defines
`XMLHttpRequest` as an external class, otherwise a warning would be
thrown.

Another thing that often happens is that JSDuck is unable to determine
into which class a member belongs and will place all such items into a
global class - you can disable this using the `--ignore-global`
switch.  For full list of all command line options type
`jsduck --help`.  For help on a specific option use
`--help=--some-option`.

To generate docs for your own project, simply name additional input
directories:

    $ jsduck ext-4.1.1/src project1/js project2/js ...

Note that the resulting documentation will only contain the API
documentation.  Guides, videos and examples will not be present.
These can be added using more command line options as explained in the
[documentation][].


Documenting your code
